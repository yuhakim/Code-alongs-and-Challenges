Hello, my name is Yuha from Y2 CNM! I'm from South Korea and this is my second year living in Singapore. I like playing the guitar and listening to J-Pop. My favorite artists are Aimyon and Fujii Kaze. This past summer, I went to Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan. I had so many good food and desserts including soup curry, cheesecake, and the best ramen I ever tried in my life. We also visited several flower gardens and saw a magnificent waterfall. The weather was cool and slightly windy, which was a perfect escape from Korea's intense summer heat. I would love to visit other parts of Japan in the future!

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
